School trip
Join us on a school trip to Cardiff on Saturday 13th May.

We will spend the morning in the city centre. For lunch we’ll have a picnic in the park. In the afternoon we will visit the Science and Technology Museum.

Price: £20

Meet in the school car park at 8:00 am. Please arrive on time. We will return to the school at 5:30 pm.

IMPORTANT: SCHOOL TRIP UPDATE
Dear Students,

We hope you can come on our school trip next weekend. Unfortunately, the Science and Technology Museum is closed for building work on Saturday, but we have got tickets for St Fagans National History Museum instead. The good news is that entry is free so the trip will now cost £10 each.

Arrival and departure times are the same.

Mr Stuart Noble

Head Teacher
